# Passport-Drupal

[Passport](http://passportjs.org/) strategy for authenticating with [Drupal](http://drupal.org/)
websites that use the [Services](http://drupal.org/project/services) and
[OAuth](http://drupal.org/project/oauth) modules.

This module lets you authenticate using a Drupal website in your Node.js
applications. By plugging into Passport, Drupal authentication can be easily and
unobtrusively integrated into any application or framework that supports
[Connect](http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/)-style middleware, including
[Express](http://expressjs.com/).

## Installation

    $ npm install passport-drupal

## Usage

#### Configure Strategy

The Drupal OAuth authentication strategy authenticates users using a Drupal
account and OAuth tokens.  The strategy requires a `verify` callback, which
accepts these credentials and calls `done` providing a user, as well as
`options` specifying a consumer key, consumer secret, and callback URL.

    passport.use(new Strategy({
        consumerKey: DRUPAL_CONSUMER_KEY,
        consumerSecret: DRUPAL_CONSUMER_SECRET,
        providerURL: "http://drupal.example.com",
        resourceEndpoint: "oauthlogin/api/user/info" // <---- optional. Defaults to `rest/system/connect`
      },
      function(token, tokenSecret, profile, done) {
        profile.oauth = { token: token, token_secret: tokenSecret };
        done(null, profile);
      }
    ));

#### Authenticate Requests

Use `passport.authenticate()`, specifying the `'drupal'` strategy, to
authenticate requests.

For example, as route middleware in an [Express](http://expressjs.com/)
application:

````JavaScript
app.get('/auth/drupal',
  passport.authenticate('drupal'),
  function(req, res) {
    // The request will be redirected to the Drupal website for
    // authentication, so this function will not be called.
});

app.get('/auth/drupal/callback',
  passport.authenticate('drupal', { failureRedirect: '/login' }),
  function(req, res) {
    // Successful authentication, redirect home.
    res.redirect('/');
});
````

If you want to store access tokens locally (e.g. in a persistent session store),
you can add something like the following to prevent requesting new ones every
time:

````JavaScript
app.get('/auth/drupal/login', function(req, res, next) {
  var tokens = req.session['my-session-key'];
  if (req.cookies['my-cookie-key'] && tokens) {
    // If all the data is there, load user profile
    strategy.userProfile(tokens.oauth_token, tokens.oauth_token_secret, {}, function(err, user) {
      if (err) return res.redirect('/auth/drupal');
      req.session.user = user;
      res.redirect('/');
    });
  } else {
    // If not, start OAuth authentication
    res.redirect('/auth/drupal');
  }
});
````

## Drupal configuration

_These instructions are for Drupal 7. For Drupal 6, refer to this issue: [https://github.com/mixmarket/passport-drupal/issues/1](https://github.com/mixmarket/passport-drupal/issues/1#issuecomment-19986969)_

* Install the following modules:
    - oauth_common (bundled with [OAuth](http://drupal.org/project/oauth))
    - oauth_common_providerui (bundled with [OAuth](http://drupal.org/project/oauth))
    - [Services](http://drupal.org/project/services)
    - rest_server (bundled with [Services](http://drupal.org/project/services))
    - services_oauth (bundled with [Services](http://drupal.org/project/services))
* Go to `admin/config/services/oauth` and check on _Enable the oauth provider_.
* On that same page, click on Add Context
    - Under _Signature Methods_, check _HMAC-SHA1_ only
    - Under _Authorization Options_, check on _Disable authorization level selection_.
    - Add an _Authorization Level_ and check on _Selected by default_.
* Go to `admin/structure/services` and click _Add_
    - Enter an endpoint path as both your machine name and path (_rest_ is a good option).
    - Select _REST_ as your Server.
    - Under _Authentication_, check _OAuth authentication_.
    - Save
* On the resulting page, click to Edit your new Service
    - On the _Server_ tab
        * Under _Response formatters_, select _json_.
        * Under _Request parsing_, select _application/json_ and _application/x-www-form-urlencoded_.
    - On the _Authentication_ tab
        * OAuth context: select context created above
        * Default required OAuth Authorization level: select level created above
        * Default required authentication: _Consumer key and access token, also known as 3-legged OAuth_
    - On the _Resources_ tab
        * Check on _system > connect_
        * Select _Default_ for the authentication options
* Go to `user/1/oauth/consumer` and click _Add consumer_
    - On _Callback url_, enter your node.js callback URL (typically _http://node.example.com/auth/drupal/callback_)
    - On _Application context_, select the context created above
* Go back to `user/1/oauth/consumer` and click _Edit_ on the new consumer to view the consumer Key and Secret.
